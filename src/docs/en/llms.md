# AIs and LLMs Compatibility

Sawabona Forms enables developers to quickly generate dynamic React forms using strict JSON schemas. Because it relies heavily on customized schemas that get parsed at runtime, this framework is exceptionally well-suited for AI generation.

If you are using Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct or manage your application, you can feed them specific guidelines to ensure they strictly output 100% compliant `FormSchema` objects.

## Instruction Files

We have prepared two instruction formats detailing our API Reference features and Golden Rules for AIs. They are functionally identical and instruct the LLM on how to write accurate `Sawabona Forms` schemas.

You can download these files and drop them directly into your LLM contexts, custom GPT instructions, or agentic frameworks.
