# Introduction

Sawabona Forms is a powerful, headless, and schema-driven form builder for React. It allows you to create complex, conversational forms (like Typeform) using a simple JSON schema.

## Features

- **Schema Driven**: Define your form logic, validation, and layout in a single JSON object.
- **Themable**: Fully customizable theming engine. Match your brand's colors, fonts, and spacing.
- **Headless**: Built on top of Radix UI and Framer Motion. You have full control over the UI.
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and small bundle size.
- **Type Safe**: First-class TypeScript support.

## Philosophy

We believe that forms should be engaging and easy to build. Most form builders are either too simple (drag-and-drop giants that output messy code) or too complex (building everything from scratch). Sawabona Forms sits in the sweet spot: declarative simplicity with the power of full-code customization.
